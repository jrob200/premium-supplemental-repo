# The Path to Launching Your MVP: Building + Launching Your MVP

If you’ve followed the steps before this section then you have validated your idea iin the following ways:  conducting customer interviews, designing a prototype in paper, a digital mock-up and if applicable, native. Through this process, you have engaged closely with your users/customers to define and refine your product (and hopefully they are excited for you to launch and will be your first users!). What awaits now, is for you to build your Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

As you may remember, an MVP is a functional version of a product that allows you to gather information, test and iterate with the purpose of validating your product. The prototypes you created are not functional - they are a vision of what you are looking to execute. You have received feedback and iterated on how to make the product work best for your users, and now it is time to execute your MVP. 

Now that you’ve learned to code and done your research, you're ready to actually build. 

So, where to begin?

## Designing Your MVP for Function

The most important aspect that differentiates an MVP from a prototype is that MVPs are built for function. Most of the time you will hear an early type of an MVP described as version 1.0 and subsequent iterations as 1.5, 2.0, and so on (you can find these numbers/descriptors on all apps and software). We are focused on building version 1.0 so you can get it out into customers hands to see how it performs. Your 1.0 will not have all of the details and functionality that you have envisioned and instead will look more like a polished and functional version of your prototype.

For your MVP, focus on having graphics/images that are clean. You can find great design templates that will give your product a uniformed look and will be nice on the eyes. Find templates in the links below under design resources. 

Your focus on this 1.0 is to prioritize the functions your users need and to build those functions. 

**Prioritizing your MVP features:**

Take your list of features and organize them from high to low. To determine what to prioritize, think about your users. What features will be the most useful to your users? For example, if your app is solving a user problem by allowing users to share specific info such as images and location with others then you should code this capability (ideally natively prototyped as well). The opposition would be to design an app in which sharing info is not central to the users experience, however, down the pipeline can be added to engage and acquire users.  

Once you’ve decided on the set of functions, organize them and begin to build the function.  

In the interim, as you gather data of users' experience with your MVP, you will work on creating a version of your product that incorporates the new feedback you are receiving as well as any updates that you were not able to make in the first version. This experience shouldn’t be daunting as you’ve spent so much time refining your product. You are coding for every interface of your product, from login to sign out.  


## Be Scrappy: Tools to Use for Your MVP

If you have to use one tool for your MVP, I only have two words. Google Sheet. Yes, Google Sheet is a multi-functional product that can work seamlessly with your product. You can use Google Sheets as a database and connect to other platforms via API. APIs can be created for free using a tool like [Sheetsu](https://sheetsu.com/). (Now that you are garnering your own coding skills, keep yourself informed on the happenings in your industry. The current legal battle between Google and Oracle over copywriting API is a must [read](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-garners-support-from-tech-industry-in-supreme-court-api-copyright-fight/) as is [California’s Consumers Privacy Act](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375) which went into effect on January 1, 2020. To make things easier, here are some plain English rundowns from [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/technology/california-privacy-law.html) and [Vox](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/30/21030754/ccpa-2020-california-privacy-law-rights-explained)).

So, how best to use Google Sheet? There are various ways to incorporate and it all depends on your product. Do you require your users to complete surveys? Are you building a recipe app? Google Sheet can assist in adding and updating content. There are various easy tools you can use (some do not involve coding) for instance, Glide Apps allows for the creation of apps using Google Sheets. Google Sheets can be plugged in to most platforms like [Adobe X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8z0l5moNIw) and Sketch. This [blog post](https://medium.com/@sumn2u/use-google-spreadsheets-as-data-backend-for-mobile-apps-6b0b5c99a99c) by Suman Kunmar lays out how to get started. 

Additional tools that you can use to build:

[IFTTT](https://platform.ifttt.com/)  (stands for “if this, then that) has brands that can be integrated into your app
[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) - spreadsheet that works like a database
[Flowxo](https://flowxo.com) - make a chatbot (no coding required)
[Dash Dash](https://dashdash.com/) - database/spreadsheet for developers 
[Sheetsu](https://sheetsu.com/) - connect Google Sheets to anything (web, mobile, IoT or any service's API)
 
There are a vast amount of resources for you as you build, along with Codecademy, Google Play has comprehensive materials on developing, launching, and growing your app. You can also use their Android Studios to develop your app and even learn how to integrate [Smart Lock Password Protection](https://developers.google.com/identity/smartlock-passwords/android) to your app.

Before you can publish your apps on Google Play and Apple’s App Store, you will need to create a developer account. Set up your accounts: 

* [Google Play Developer](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435)
* [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/)

## Set Goals for Your Launch

Setting goals for your MVP will help tremendously in staying focused and allows you to have a compass to navigate the experience. The key to goal setting your MVP is to: 

* Keep the goals small
* Have clear and simple objectives 
* Set milestones and deadlines
* Track your goals weekly 

While it is easy to dream big and plan lofty goals for your product, starting with big goals can quickly become overwhelming and cause discouragement. The best way to make it to your big goals is to begin with small and approachable ones. Small goals can best be mitigated by making them uncomplicated. Having clear, simple and practical goals will make it easy for others to understand (should you bring others to assist), are less daunting and give you the capability to achieve them. 

For example, one of the primary goals for your MVP is to get the product into the hands of as many people as possible. Think about how many users would be needed to validate one of your theories? In the beginning of launch, you will be using your network for your launch (more on networking below), think about what a successful first milestone would look like. Let’s say, a goal of attaining 100 users in the first 3 months of launch is one of your goals. 

Keep in mind certain factors that could hinder your goal. For instance, if your product is an app and is only available on Android (Google) - that certainly limits the number of downloads as [Apple is the most popular mobile operating system in the U.S.](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america) Does your app ask downloaders to create an account or complete a survey before getting access to the application? That could be a factor (not in the number of downloads) but in user engagement going forward. 

Your goal will not be the same as everyone else’s and that's okay! We are setting goals that are manageable and achievable for you. 

## How to set your goal 

First, define your primary goal. An example of what a primary goal could be is _getting 100 downloads by a certain date._

Next, set up tasks to help achieve the goal of 100 downloads (tasks include but not limited to: reaching out to your network, having friends + family do outreach, social media, etc).

Measure the impact each time a task is completed. How did each task allow you to get closer to your goal? Did you see an uptick in downloads? If so, how many downloads? Were there certain tasks that produce low participation? Take time to reevaluate the tasks so that they can help meet the primary goal. 

Celebrate when a goal is reached (because you deserve it). 

If your product is specialized and for a specific target customer like a business - it may be the main goal for the first launch could be to acquire one company to try your product. The tasks can revolve around outreach to those businesses, possibly demoing your product and follow up in order to attain the goal. 

## Talking About Your MVP

You have discussed your product with people through customer interviews, etc. Now that you’ve built your MVP and will be going out there in the world to promote it, it’s best practice to formulate a succinct pitch that you can share when speaking to potential customers. We’ll focus on a one minute pitch that will help you draw people in. When creating your pitch focus on answering the following questions:

#### What? 
What is the problem you are solving? Describe the problem. 

#### How? 
How does your product solve the problem? 

#### Why?
Why is your solution the best to solve this problem? 

#### Who?
Who is solving the product and why are you the best person to do this? Talk yourself up!

Take some time to formulate one to two sentences for each question above. Be clear and try not to use jargon. Once you’ve written down your responses, read it out loud and see how it feels. Practicing is the key with refining your pitch so practice, practice, practice. Practice on your own and in front of others for feedback. 

## Marketing Your MVP

When marketing your MVP the best tools are already at your disposal and better yet they are free! Using your network to reach new potential customers is a powerful tool - as word of mouth is one of the most influential ways one can attract customers. 

When you are ready to launch your MVP, your network is the best resource you have. Your network is composed of people who are supportive of your endeavors. Your network can connect you with potential customers in the following ways: 

Bringing general awareness to your product/company (an example of this would be sharing a post on LinkedIn to congratulate you on your launch) 

Recommending your products to others (whether through word of mouth, social media, a blog, product review, etc) 

Providing feedback (as we have learned is important for iteration). You can still receive feedback from your network even if they will not be using your product. Ask them their thoughts on your marketing/outreach to them.  

Ways to utilize your network during your MVP launch: 

On the day of your launch, send your network an email telling them all about it. Make it short (if you can) and end it with 1 to 3 actionable items. Actionable items can include: sharing the email with their network, following your business social media accounts and/or recommending your product with others. 

Reach out to your network should you need advice in areas that are not your expertise or to be connected to an expert. Don’t be shy to ask for help but also don’t take it personal if someone is not able to assist. Unfortunately, not everyone has the time, ask for referrals or resources you can access if someone is not available to help. 

The most valuable act your network can do for you is to hype you up! Making your network a part of the process can go a long way to ensure success so create ways that will make it easy for them to spread the word! 

Another tool for marketing is social media. Social media is the most powerful tool you can use (and platforms offer business acco. It is basically *free advertisement* and allows potential customers to find you from wherever they are. When using social media, it’s best to focus on the platforms where your customers are. Is Instagram their primary social account? Do they spend most of their time in Facebook Groups? Through your customer interviews, you should have gotten a sense of your customer’s lifestyle and which social media (if any) they spend the most time on and perhaps find new products. If your product is business to business (B2B) and social media will not be used primarily to attract customers, then social media can be utilized to engage in conversation within your industry. For example, if climate change is your focus, you may find Twitter as the best platform to share articles, information and take part in discussions with thought leaders. By all means, let your audience know what you do/build but your content will be a different approach to a consumer brand. 

Before leaping and posting on social media, create a content strategy. Consider the following: 

Who you want to engage with
The type of posts you will be creating (inspirational or informational)
How you will engage with your user/audience (replying to comments, live streaming, etc.)
The frequency in which you posts/engage

Set a schedule for yourself (or team) and create the content in advance. You may want to have one day of the week where you focus on content creation and scheduling. Then the rest of the week can be spent on posting and engaging with your audience.  

When coming up with the name for your company along with obtaining the website, create social media accounts and grab your company name handles (you may have to get creative if it is taken) on all of the platforms. If you are not planning to utilize all of the platforms when launching or are in the early stages and want to focus on a platform where your customers are, that’s fine! Acquiring your handles now will save you time and headache (should someone else own the name/handle) in the future when you are ready to participate in social media.  
 

## Your MVP Feedback 

When building your prototype, feedback from potential users is crucial in determining how users interact with your product and assisting you in deciding what functions to prioritize first in building your MVP.   Continuing to procure feedback from your users is essential to moving forward and refining the product. Feedback will be better understanding of your users, identify areas of improvement, determine future patterns, improve your content and messages. Before launch, consider what feedback you are looking for, how you will obtain it and organize it. 

#### Decide what kind of feedback you want to collect

You can do this by developing theories about how your users will interact with your product. Create a theory on how customers use a particular feature and why they would use it. 

#### Set up a timeframe

Calculate a timeframe for when you will need to have all of your feedback and more importantly when you will be reaching out to your users for feedback. Based on your hypothesis, you may want to reach out after they’ve completed a task or purchase. However, the sooner you can make a touch point with your users, the better. Having a close connection with your users will go a long way and building a product your users really want. I recommend finding a way to reach out to the user once they have your product. If your product collects emails, send users an email and let them know you are available for questions/feedback and share the best way to contact you. 

#### Set a feedback collection method

There are different ways to gather the feedback such as surveys, interviews, etc which depends on what types of feedback you are looking for, timeline and your schedule. We will review the methods below. 

#### Collect the feedback

Once you’ve decided how you will be collecting the feedback, make sure to set up how this information will be organized. If you are having phone interviews - create templates to make sure you take detailed notes and save it appropriately so you may share with others. 

#### Analyzing and executing learnings

At the end of your timeline, when you have gathered users' feedback, go back to your hypothesis, were you correct in your theory? Our users using the functions as they were intended? Is there anything that surprises you? Do any patterns emerge? What updates or new designs would be helpful to users now? 

There are different ways to collect feedback, in the early stages of building your product, the more you can interact and learn from your user, the more you will be able to build a product that will solve your users problem. The most ideal situation would be to be able to be with your user when they are using the app. If your product is targeting businesses, consider spending time at the businesses itself to observe how it is being used (please discuss with your user if this is something they are comfortable with given COVID19).  A bonus to being in the same space is that you can often troubleshoot and resolve issues quicker. 

Surveys are one of the most direct ways in which to gather feedback. Surveys have a set of questions in which responses are open-ended or have a list of suggested answers. Surveys can have a mix of both. Surveys can be done via email, online or in phone interviews. [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) is a great and free tool that everyone can use for surveying and can be shared online or sent via email. For phone interviews, consider reaching out to conduct a (short 15 min) phone call when the user has taken an action such as a purchase. Have your email scripts ready to send out and even include the questions you will ask. Send your email out within the hour of an action taking place to ensure high engagement. 

Social media can be used as well to do surveys. Scheduling a Ask Me Anything (AMA) on Instagram Live or Twitter (if you do not want to use social media, you can do a Zoom meeting). 

**Survey questions can include:**

* What challenges are you having that made you seek out our product? 
* What about our marketing and branding stands out?
* What made you download (or purchase) the product? 
* What can we improve? 
* On a scale of 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest), how likely are you to recommend our product to family and friends? (This is the classic [NPS](https://www.netpromoter.com/know/) question)

Other information that can be collected is the actions taken within an app, website or platform using tools like Google Analytics. If customers can make purchases, you can use a third party tracking tool to pull data onto a spreadsheet or wherever you decide to store this data. Social media has their own analytics which you can monitor and analyze. If you are sending emails/ newsletters through an email marketing tool such as [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) - the services provide analytics on open rates, click rates, etc for the marketing emails. These other data points are another way to learn about your user however the survey method really provides a path for you to build a close relationship with your users and allows for users to be invested in the product by having their needs heard. 


## Incorporation

When you launch your MVP, your business must be incorporated. When deciding the [type of corporate structure](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure) for your business, you may need to consider taxes, business objectives and goals as well as the ease in which you can switch (convert) the structure. I am not a legal expert and the information provided in this article should not be taken as legal advice. Please seek the consultation of a lawyer who can go over with you the details of incorporation ( and all other legal matters) to help you make an informed decision. If you do not know where to find a lawyer, I recommend [Court Buddy](https://www.courtbuddy.com/types-of-legal-cases/business-lawyers) which can match you with a lawyer for a flat fee. 

Incorporation can be done online. Check out the website of the state you're incorporating in, for information on filing requirements, time frame, resources and assistance (and of course, reach out to a lawyer!). 


## Charging Users/Customers 
 
One of the most frequently asked questions is of charging customers when launching an MVP.  If your future goal is to have customers pay for the product/service, you can certainly wait to charge. However, charging customers from the very beginning sets expectations early between you and your users and secondly, shows that users are willing to pay (and do pay), which becomes another validation point. 

From your customer interviews and prototyping, you should have a sense of what users are willing to pay for your product and you can use the learnings to inform the price. As you gain new knowledge, feedback and changes to your products, your pricing may change. (Note: incorporate your business before charging users, see the incorporation section above.)


## Conclusion

Throughout this series you’ve gained insight on what you’ll need to build and launch your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In entrepreneurship, there are no hard rules on executing your product, only guides. Let the users be a part of building the product (you are solving a problem for them) so continue being engaged with your users and keep the feedback loop open. Have fun, experiment, ask questions, learn from others, celebrate your milestones and don’t let the setbacks deter you from building. You can do this! Now go forth and build an amazing MVP!

We would love to know what you are building, share it with us!
