# How Digital Teams Work
Thus far in the repo we’ve looked at [software development methodologies](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/general-advice/10-intro-to-software-development-methodologies.md) and if you're looking for a programming job you've probably read [what to expect on your first day as a programmer](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/getting-a-developer-job/xx-your-first-job-as-a-programmer.md). If you haven’t yet read those pieces, we suggest reviewing them in conjunction with this one, as all three revolve around the same core topic: how software development gets done in the 'real world.' Most self-taught coders are primarily preoccupied with learning how to code and obtaining a job. Which is great, we want you to do those things. But before you get that first job on a development team, it’s _crucial_ to understand how digital teams work. You’ve taught yourself how to code solo (well, with Codecademy’s help!) and have likely been doing most or all of your coding on your own. You may have engaged in [pair programming](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/group-coding-how-to/pair-programming-guide.md) - hooray, another repo link! But once you join a team, you will learn quickly that product development is a group effort unlike anything in your coding journey thus far. 
 
This is a question that few people think to ask before they join a digital team, and yet it’s one of the most important parts of any job - understanding what you do and how it fits into the larger picture of what everyone around you is doing. None of us work in a vacuum, and you certainly don’t want to piss someone off by asking them to do something that isn’t their job (or by not doing something that everyone else understands is part of *your* job). But you’re not going to be “that guy” because you’re reading this! (“Guy” is a non-gendered term in this context. We see you, female and non-gender-conforming developers!) 
 
Let’s dig in.
 
## Who is on a digital team?
Digital teams are comprised of and work with a number of people with different skills and responsibilities. Understanding who everyone is and how they work together will give you a leg up in your first job on a team, and help you acclimate more quickly. 
 
The composition of each digital team will vary by size of company and company culture. Some teams have a handful of people, [as outlined here](https://this.isfluent.com/blog/2018/roles-and-responsibilities-in-a-software-development-team); others fill the dozen-plus roles [identified in this post about digital teams](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/how-to-structure-your-digital-team-15-critical-roles/). It’s a good bet that your team will include the following: developers, a product manager, a project manager, a designer, and a QA tester. 
 
* _Developers._ As you know, these are the folks writing the code that builds the product. There are junior and senior developers, and ones tasked to specific parts of a project (front end, back end, etc.) Since we have other resources on types of developers, we won’t go into detail here, but we will cover how best to communicate with developers below.   
* _A product manager and a project manager:_ We created [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbPWW6LEMSg&feature=youtu.be) to go through what a product manager does, and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7g4eourYwI&feature=youtu.be) to describe what a project manager does. People do often confuse the two, so we recommend reviewing [this article](https://www.paymoapp.com/blog/product-manager-vs-project-manager/) and [this one](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/project-manager-vs-product-manager/) to bone up on the difference. While there are some similarities in their roles and skill sets, these are two distinct roles with different goals and business purposes. It’s highly likely that every digital team that you work on will have both a product manager and a project manager involved.   
* _Designers:_ it’s also common to work closely with a UX (user experience) and/or a UI (user interface) designer. These are also two roles that are sometimes confused for the other. [This article](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/the-difference-between-ux-and-ui-design-a-laymans-guide/) lays out the differences between UX and UI design, as does [this one](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/ui-vs-ux). Want a reminder on how to communicate with designers? Head back to [this piece in the repo](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/general-advice/12-design-for-developers.md).
* _QA:_ Quality assurance testing can be conducted by a few different types of testers. There is a comprehensive outline of them all [here](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/qa-engineering-roles-skills-tools-and-responsibilities-within-a-testing-team/).  
 
 
## Your team within a team - the developers
Now that we all understand that a digital team is made up of more than just developers/engineers, it’s time to take a closer look at working effectively on a developer team. 
### Team dynamics
Your dev team may be three people, or thirty people, or three hundred people (SPARTAAAAA!) If you end up working for a mid-size or large company, don’t be afraid to *ask to see the org chart,* or to have someone explain it to you. It’s helpful to have a bird’s-eye view of where you and your work fit in. 
 
* **Video:** [10 tips for working on a dev team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVXwFairWKs&t=10s)
We have put together this ten-minute overview of *how* to work on a dev team. It’s incredibly useful for brand-new developers and career-switchers. While some of what it covers may seem like common sense, we encourage you to watch it because those common sense principles are the fundamentals of teamwork. 
 
* **Video:** [Software team organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q626z6dNzM)
Dave Xiang has unwittingly created this video in a manner similar to how Codecademy does - he’s in the corner and the bulk of the screen is his screen - so we hope the unusual format doesn’t throw you. He goes through different types of software teams based on the size of the company and the approach to what the teams work on and *how quickly,* which is an important consideration. 
 
* **Video:** [Things I Was Unprepared For As A Lead Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwuqJ1qORag)
It is also always a good idea to understand what your manager’s role is and what his/her/their priorities are. The better you understand their problems, the more useful you can be in solving them, and solving your manager’s problems is the best way to advance in your career. So, if you’d like to get a peek inside what your lead developer is dealing with and thinking about, watch this video. Do watch it at 1.5x speed - it’s a great look at many facets of leading a dev team, but the speaker talks quite slow and I don’t want you to lose interest before getting to the good stuff he covers! If you’re a more experienced developer looking to become a lead developer, this video will also be useful for you. 
 
* **Article:** [10 Ways To Become A Better Developer Through Teamwork](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-ways-to-become-a-better-developer-through-teamwork/)
Being a great team player doesn’t just benefit the company - it also benefits you! A lot of what is covered in this article falls under the category of “team culture.” Good culture can and often does make or break your experience on a dev team. Practicing the rules outlined in this article will contribute to good team culture. 
 
And finally - [this post on communicating with developers](https://medium.com/flatiron-labs/how-to-work-with-developers-a-guide-for-non-developers-f071d5b851ce). For those of you trying to be a developer… we know, we know, you don't want a guide to talk to yourself, but you’re new so it helps to have an intro to dev-speak, you're not going to necessarily be fluent on day one. It can also come in handy when figuring out what non-developers are trying to say to you!
 
# Conclusion
This is a high-level look at the intricacies of digital teams. We encourage you to talk to your coaches, mentors, and friends about their experiences on digital teams and what they wished they knew about the actual day-to-day of working with so many other people. It will be enlightening! And probably entertaining as well.
